# LetsGetMarried.NYC

## Wedding Officiant services
### Legally submitted via existing official paper license 
### Registered on the blockchain… 

**Who?**
- 2+ Individuals (Spouses)
- 1+ Witnesses (Witness)

**All Spouses and Witnesses will need to use a digital ID**
*Need existing digital IDs (link out to create one if needed)*

**How?**

All Persons sign transaction to instantiate smart contract using Digital IDs
This represents the consensus agreement that the ceremony has taken place
After all digital signatures are added the officiant executes the smart contract.
The contract is considered official when confirmed on blockchain shortly thereafter.
There is no end date for the contract.


Note:
Currently, only two-partner relationships are recognized by NYC,
but the contract is built so it can support multiple partner relationships
in the future (e.g. don’t limit to two on the back end, we’ll do that on the front end only for now).

**What?**

Questions:
How exactly is it registered? Where? 
Should we assume uPort and Ethereum? 
Do they need a wallet, or can they pay us US$ and we initiate Ethereum contract?

I don’t see a need to use wedding.io or mywish or other platforms but let me know if you do

Not in scope: family contracts, vows, definition of marriage, finance, budgeting, etc. This is simpler: it’s just about identity and creating an alternative means to publicly record a legal marriage.

Maybe in scope, later: divorce (spousal Digital ID public keys used to end the contract); widowing (not sure what happens to Digital IDs on death, maybe a single ID can be used to initiate this? Will need more thought on this.)
